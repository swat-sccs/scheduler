# SCCS Course Planner (Legacy)

Scraper-based scheduling website to allow students to plot out classes with dates and times and export recurring classes as an iCalendar file.

## Development Environment Setup

### With VS Code

For machines with Visual Studio Code installed, a devcontainer configuration is included to automatically set up a Docker-based development environment with just a couple clicks. At this time the container is not hosted in a registry, so you'll have to clone the repo and build the container yourself.

#### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- VS Code Remote-Containers extension
- Docker (Docker Desktop with WSL2 on Windows 10+, Docker Desktop on macOS, `docker.io` package on Linux-based systems)

#### Steps

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swat-sccs/scheduler.git
    ```

2. Launch VS Code in the `scheduler/` directory

    ```bash
    code ./scheduler/
    ```

3. Select "Reopen in Container" in the popup at the botttom right

### Without VS Code

Those without VS Code installed will have to clone the repo and edit files natively instead of in a container unless another way of building the Dockerfile in a usable way is discovered (feel free to edit the config later as long as you don't break anything).

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20
- `npm` 10.x.x (preferred latest for Node.js 20, recommended to use `nvm`)

#### Steps

1. Clone and enter the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swat-sccs/scheduler.git && cd scheduler
    ```

2. Install `npm` packages

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Using the Development Environment

Several `npm` scripts are included for your convenience:

```bash
npm run build           # Builds for production
npm start               # Run development instance
```

If you get an error running one of these scripts, it's probably due to a missing or broken dependency. As per standard with `npm`-based projects, fix this with one of the following:

```bash
npm install <missing-dep>               # Installs a missing dependency
npm install -g <missing-global-dep>     # Installs a missing global-required dependency
npm update                              # Updates packages (or just kinda doesn't)
npm audit fix                           # Supposedly fixes broken packages
npm audit fix --force                   # Actually fixes broken packages but often breaks
                                        # more in the process
```
