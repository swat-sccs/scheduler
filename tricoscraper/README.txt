Scraper for tricollege website (https://trico.haverford.edu/cgi-bin/courseguide/cgi-bin/search.cgi). This has some modifications from Kei's great library - https://github.com/keikun555/tricoscraper.

It used python threads (GIL no more :-) ) to scrape all Swarthmore classes, although it can also do brynmawr/haverford (note that there are some specific ways they each display classes and this is optimized for Swarthmore)
